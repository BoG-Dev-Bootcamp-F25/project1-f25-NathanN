// This component should have a prop specifying the line color (i.e. blue, gold, red, or green), 
// and would contain the interface for all trains in the given line. The current line that's 
// being displayed should be stored as a state in the LinesPage component.

// Within the TrainList.tsx component, the data should be filtered to only return info for trains that are part of the specific line. 
// For example, for the gold line we only want an array of gold trains.
