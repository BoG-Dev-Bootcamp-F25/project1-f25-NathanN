/* 
    This will contain an exportable navbar display component, which we can import into LinesPage.tsx. 
    The navbar component will be displayed with the props for their specific lines.

    We also want four filter buttons to be displayed titled 'Arriving', 'Scheduled', 'Northbound', and 'Southbound' on each of the pages. 
    For the green and blue lines, use 'Eastbound' and 'Westbound' instead of 'Northbound' and 'Southbound'.
